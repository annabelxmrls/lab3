        <h2>Let's explore mouse events!</h2>

        <h3>Display Mouse Position</h3>
        <p>As the mouse moves around a specific area and clicks, the mouse's position will be displayed for the user to see. Try it out and click anywhere on the image of the meadow below!</p>

        <div class="position">
            <h4>Where around this meadow did I click?</h4>
            <h5 id="point">0, 0</h5>
            <p>You may also look at the console for additional information!</p>
        </div>

        <div class="trigger">
        <h3>Trigger Animations</h3>
        <p>When the mouse clicks on a specific element, an animation is triggered and it usually involves a styled element moving to the position where the mouse clicked. Let's add a butterfly to the meadow by clicking on the image below. Then, click around the meadow to make the butterfly fly around! Reminder to look at the console log as well!</p>
        </div>

        <div class="container" id="container">
            <div id="insect" class="butterfly"></div>
        </div>

        <h3 class="more">More Trigger Animations!</h3>
        <p>You can also trigger other animations with other ways of using your mouse. First, you can hold down the mouse over the daytime landscape image to see it as a nighttime image. Don't forget to look at the console log too!</p>

        <div id="down"></div>

        <p>Now try double clicking over the nighttime image below to turn it into the daytime image!</p>

        <div id="double"></div>
